Key Results
###########

   * To increase employee satisfaction and employee effectiveness, I led an
     initiative to identify gaps in mentorship resources and enable employees to
     be able to utilize existing resources. Over a period of one quarter, I increased the
     awareness of existing mentorship resources by 35%, as measured by survey
     responses.
   * Reduced turnaround time from content freeze to validation from eight days
     down to four days, by setting up standards for customer-ready documentation
     and working with our infrastructure team to automate tasks. This enabled the
     validation team to have more time to complete their tests, and enabled
     Technical Writers to have documentation ready earlier so they would not hold
     up the release process. 
   * Coordinated multiple teams to deliver 100% of
     documents on time for nine software releases across multiple publication
     platforms. 
   * Planned three major releases up to 18 months in advance, which
     included negotiating requirements and defining the scope for documentation
     projects with multiple external teams, including development, validation, and
     User Experience teams.
   * Created a method for exporting content from IBM DOORS Next
     Generation into a customer-ready document that reduced publishing time from
     five days down to one day.
   * Created a way to convert content from IBM DOORS Next Generation into HTML content
     with code snippet collapsing and highlighting using a combination of Doxygen
     and JavaScript.

Retrospectives for Process Improvement
**************************************

For every release cycle, I captured issues loged them in a Jira
for a future retrospective meeting. After the release, I set up a retrospective meeting
where we:
- discussed the issues 
- assigned tasks as needed 
- followed up with task owners to ensure we are improved our processes for future releases
 
As a result of these
retrospectives, I implemented new methods such as:

   * Added program manager support in Europe so our European validation team could
     get answers to questions during their business hours.
   * Removed duplicated content that was confusing customers. 
   * Required explicit links instead of simple
     links in reStructuredText documentation. 
   * Added tasks such as renewing permissions to the release calendar so that permissions
     are handled well before the release.
   * Compiled false positive issues found by validation into a database so that the same 
     false positives are not reported in future releases.
   * Revied and updated our Doc Specs after every release, a document which describes key
     details about a document: stakeholders, release cadence, how to build
     documentation, and where source files are located.
