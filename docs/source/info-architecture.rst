Get Started Entry Points
************************

For quarterly software releases at Intel, I worked with our User Expereince team to
optimize the experience for developers who were new to the IntelÂ® oneAPI ecosystem of  
compilers, libraries, and tools. We determined where users were coming from and
where to guide them for the next step.

Get Started Next Steps
**********************

After a user completes the get started steps, they run a sample to ensure the
system is working correctly. From there, the user gets directed to next level
steps or the troubleshooting guide.

        an unsuccessful run directs them to the Troubleshooting Guide.
