From the time I played my first video game, I have had a passion for technology. I
have spent my career learning about the workings of computers, cell phones,
cloud technology and cyber security. As a frequent user of these technologies, I
have a respect for documentation when it is done right. And I strive to give my
users an experience I would want: best-in-class documentation.

For the past five years, I worked with stakeholders to develop documentation
that meets users' needs and provides a positive user experience. I collaborated
with engineers, designers, program managers, and our user experience team to
identify upcoming features and understand the needs of our audience.

Any of my references will tell you that I am an excellent communicator with
exceptional collaboration and influencing skills. I often am tasked with leading
project teams with a specific purpose because I have a track record of getting
positive results. As a skilled Technical Writer, I am able to research and learn
about complex topics then summarize the content into user-friendly documentation
for the target audience. I am eager to put these skills to use as a writer,
editor, and collaborator.


The samples below will show you how I demonstrate high quality work in these areas:
