Portfolio of Vikram Srinivasan

Welcome to my portfolio!

For the past five years, I worked with stakeholders to develop documentation
that meets usersâ€™ needs and provides a positive user experience. I collaborated
with engineers, designers, program managers, and our user experience team to
identify upcoming features and understand needs of our audience. To achieve
results, I implemented creative solutions such as:

* a minimum quality standard so that we could regularly deliver packages to validation four
  days early
* a release schedule that prompted the documentation team to complete non-critical tasks
  ahead of time to avoid interference with tasks at the end of the release cycle

Any of my references will tell you that I am an excellent communicator with
exceptional collaboration and influencing skills. I often am tasked with leading
project teams with a specific purpose because I have a track record of getting
positive results. 

After nearly 25 years at Intel, I took a voluntary severance package to pursue
new adventures. I would appreciate the opportunity to tell you more about myself and
how my skill for building collaborative relationships and being a positive influence
can help your company.

Cross references (internal links)
---------------------------------

To create a cross reference from one page of this document to another page,
ensure that an explicit target is used so that the cross reference is pointing to a unique identifier, rather than a heading that could be repeated somewhere else in the document.

The syntax for explicit targets is as follows:

For the target:

    .. _my-page:

    My Page of Information
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the cross reference:

    To learn more about my information, see :ref:`My Page of Information <my-page>`
